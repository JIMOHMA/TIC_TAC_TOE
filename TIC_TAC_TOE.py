## The X-player and the O-player


## Introduction of what the tic tac toe game is all about.
##A tic-tac-toe board is 3x3, hence our board needs to store 9 pieces of information,
## which are the inputof X's and O's. 
##A general overview of the board with its coordinate system is shown below;
##    1,1 | 2,1 | 3,1
##    ---------------
##    1,2 | 2,2 | 3,2
##    ---------------
##    1,3 | 2,3 | 3,3
##This game requires two players to play it.
## Of course there could be another version where a player plays against the
## computer, but for simplicity, we're going to stick with 2 human players.
## Since there are only 8 ways for a player to win we could define them explicitly in our
## program. The possible combinations are; i)the diagonals (1,1)(2,2)(3,3), (1,3)(2,2)(3,1)
## ii) the columns (1,1)(1,2)(1,3), (2,1)(2,2)(2,3), (3,1)(3,2)(3,3) and
## iii) the rows  (1,1)(2,1)(3,1), (1,2)(2,2)(3,2), (1,3)(2,3)(3,3)
## A player wins by getting "three in a row" and the game is over when this happens.

                              # from 0. so if col& row was 2, we would get grid[1][1]
                              # which would be the center position on the board
